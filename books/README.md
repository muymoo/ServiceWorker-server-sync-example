# Books
User can download /cache  book/s for later use. USERs would like to view their books when offline or going in and out of areas with low connectivity.

## Full book, half a book, bit of a book?
In this use case I suppose a user could want to download a whole book (e.g. for a city travel guide) or just a portion of a book (e.g. next chapter of a novel). I should think we would want to capture all of these cases, but please feel free to implement as much as you can out of the following:

* Download a whole book
* Download a portion of a book (e.g. chapter)
* See books covers in a 'library'
* See which books are cached and which are not.
* User selects which books to download, and which not to
