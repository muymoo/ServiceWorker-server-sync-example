# Cache This
User can cache webpages for a simple info-based site. This could be a wiki, a page from a travel site or an article (arguably the user should 'cache' a portion or the page - like the article - rather than a page itself, this use case could be stated as feeding the web in the state it is and not contributing to the evolution of webapps, however, many people still want this use case, so it may still be worth exloring). This could work a little like Evernote Web Clipper.

## Cool additions (optional)
Additons to this app could include some of the other Use Cases that Evernote Web Clipper has; this could include: caching only the selected parts of a page, caching just the article, highlighting sections for cache.
