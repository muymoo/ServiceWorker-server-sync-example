# Update
One of the benefits of the web is the fact that the user always (or almost always) sees the most up to date version of any web-app or web-site. When we start introducing complex caching methods the issue arises of when a web-app’s assets have been updated then how does a “cached” web app know this has happened?

In this use case the user should be able to know that they are seeing a cached version of something, and should see an option to redownload a more up-to-date version. User should then also be informed of any updates to the page if one occured.
