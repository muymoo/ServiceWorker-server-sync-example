# Cache Index

A user may wish to view pages they have added to a ServiceWorker cache, and then remove them if they wish. In this use case the user can refer to an index of pages they have cached offline, built by the site.

This might work well with the [wiki-read-later](/examples/wiki-read-later) use case.
